# QL
* Think of something to do.
* Syntax: getting Ident of QL and IdentIdent of QLS in sync, and extracting them
to separate syntax module. We also should use keyword exclusion in a 
consistent way. 
* Usage of ParseHelpers outside 'test' package
* Cleanup parentheses code

## BONUS:
* HTML templating
* Parantheses support
* Randomized testing for semantic checker
* Bonus exercise for Rascal variants: use SAT/SMT/Constraint solver to check for non-determinism.

# QLS
* Refactor SemanticChecker
* Refactor StyleHelpers
* Wider styling support
* /A[DS]T/ reuse

# Both
* Checking of the QLS language against the QL language
* Compiler
* Refactoring
* Adding comments
* Remove all old main()s
