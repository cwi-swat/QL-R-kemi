# About

Code for the Rascal variant of lab assignment Software Construction 2012-2013. 
The assignment can be found at [this page](doc/Assignment.md). 
We did 'Variant 3: Advanced Track'.

In short: We have created a DSL to declare questionnaires. 
These declarations will be compiled to a interactive questionnaire consisting of a HTML form, JavaScript control flow and input checking and PHP input validation (resulting in a validated JSON object containing all the answers). 

The second part of this assignment was building a DSL which extends the questionnaires, by being able to declare styling attributes for the questionnaire. 
This will generate additional CSS and JavaScript to enhance the questionnaire with the styling attributes.
